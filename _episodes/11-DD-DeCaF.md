title: "11. Data-driven design of cell factories using the DD-DeCaF platform"
teaching: 15
exercises: 30
questions:
- Can computational strain design algorithms outperform humans in enumerating promising strategies using metabolic models?
objectives:
- Upload and analyze physiology data to the platform.
- Manually construct strain designs.
keypoints:
- "Ideally, computer-aided design software would aid bench biologists in cell factory engineering. Existing software is still not on par with programming libraries such as cameo and cobrapy in terms of features and flexibility."
