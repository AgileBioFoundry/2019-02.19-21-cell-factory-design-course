title: "Gene expression modulation"
teaching: 30 min
exercises: 30 min
questions:
- How can I interpret transcriptomic/proteomic data in the context of a metabolic model?
- How do I visualize omics data in the context of pathways?
objectives:
- Learn how to visualize omics data using Escher.
- Learn how to run GIMME, iMat and other related methods for integrating expression data into models.
keypoints:
- "`cameo.strain_design.DifferentialFVA` uses flux variability analysis to compare flux ranges of reactions in production state vs. wild type state to determine which fluxes need to go up or down."
