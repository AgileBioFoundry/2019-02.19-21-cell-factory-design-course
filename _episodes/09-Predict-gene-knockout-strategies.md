title: "9. Gene deletion strategies"
teaching: 30
exercises: 30
questions:
- How does one reroute flux towards production using gene deletions?
objectives:
- Understand of a growth-coupled design.
keypoints:
- "`cameo.strain_design.OptGene` is strain design methods that utilizes genetic algorithms to determine gene (or reaction) knockout combinations that are likely to increase production."
- "`cameo.strain_design.OptKnock` use mixed integer linear programming to compute knockout combinations that couple production to growth."
