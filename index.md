With data generation becoming evermore easy in biology, life scientists and engineers are increasingly facing challenges in analyzing data in their line of work. For example, simple bioinformatics tasks can become a huge drain on scientists’ time as they repetitively copy and paste information into web interfaces instead of running batch operations.
Furthermore, with genetic manipulations becoming evermore easy to carry out, qualifications demanded of cell factory engineers will shift away from the ability to construct strains towards analysis of data and design of new strains, a trend that is only going to be accelerated with DNA synthesis costs plummeting and lab automation becoming more widely available. Therefore, it will be essential that the next generation of MSc/PhD students and Postdocs in cell factory engineering are trained in computational tools needed for data analysis and strain design.

As a first step towards this goal, two courses (two days each) will be held back to back:
1.	A Software Carpentry course that covers basic computational skills and specifically targets life scientists (task automatization, command line usage, programming with Python, data analysis with R etc.). Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching basic lab skills for research computing to scientists and engineers and course materials have continuously been adapted and tailored to their problems and needs.
2.	Taking advantage of the materials covered in (1), a computational cell factory design course that covers basic genome-scale metabolic modeling and in silico strain design methods will be held for people involved in strain engineering projects or metabolic research in general.

People are not required to attend both courses, but for the 2nd course we expect people to either attend the first course or have significant programming experience with Python.

The courses will take place from 5–8 of September starting with the software carpentry course. Furthermore, to counteract the forgetting curve and bring the learned skills into practice, weekly follow up meetings will be organized at CfB to help scientists apply the newly gained knowledge in their own projects.
